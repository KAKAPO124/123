# 1.1 Non-constant Volatility Model: GARCH Model
We have selected the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to capture the non-constant volatility characteristics of the historical data, where we continue our analysis by using the logarithmic price difference as the yield metric. We used the GARCH(1,1) model to fit the log returns data, which is effective at capturing volatility clustering.

$$\begin{array}{rcl}\ln S(t_{i+1})-\ln S(t_i)&=&\left(\mu-\dfrac{1}{2}\sigma_{i+1}^2\right)\Delta t+\sigma_{i+1}\Delta B\end{array}$$

We assume the volatility $\sigma_{i+1}$ between dates $t_i$ and $t_i+1$ is given by

$$\sigma_{i+1}^2=a+by_i^2+c\sigma_i^2$$

for some constants $a>0,b\geq0$ and $c\geq0$, with $y_i$ now defined by

$$y_i=\frac{\ln S(t_i)-\ln S(t_{i-1})-\left(\mu-\frac12\sigma_i^2\right)\Delta t}{\sqrt{\Delta t}}$$

Here we simplify as

$$y_i=\frac{\ln S(t_i)-\ln S(t_{i-1})}{\sqrt{\Delta t}}$$

The GARCH Model results are as follows:

## Plot Results

### (a)Log Returns
![Plot of AAPL Log Returns](output_plot1.png)

The volatility clustering observed with periods of large spikes followed by calmer intervals aligns closely with the assumptions of the GARCH model, which captures both changing volatility and mean-reversion. The consistency in fluctuation patterns around zero demonstrates that the model effectively captures the underlying dynamics of the data, showcasing its capability to estimate and predict conditional volatility over time.

### (b)Estimated Volatility

The graph of estimated volatility shows how the model accurately captures the dynamic changes in volatility and represent changes in market volatilityover time, with notable spikes during periods of market turbulence. The gradual decrease and stabilization in the conditional volatility suggest periods of lower market fluctuation, showing that the model accurately tracks both high and low volatility phases.

# 1.3 Volatility Smile
- Using implied volatility from AAPL options with different Time to Maturity (TTM) and strike prices to construct the volatility smile allows us to see how market expectations for volatility vary depending on the time remaining until expiration and the difference between strike prices and the current stock price.
- We have filtered out extreme implied volatility values and inconsistencies, such as unusually high or low volatility or unreasonable changes. This ensures that the volatility smile represents accurate and meaningful market trends.

The graph highlights the predictive capability of the GARCH model by demonstrating how it adapts to changes in market conditions over time. The GARCH model’s ability to estimate these periods of increased risk accurately aligns with real-world events, reinforcing its effectiveness. Moreover, the smooth transitions between volatility spikes and lower values indicate the model’s robustness in capturing persistence in market behavior — where high volatility is often followed by more high volatility.
