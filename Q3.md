# Q3: Variance Reduction in Monte Carlo Simulation

## 3.1 Basic Setup

In this section, we will use the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** model to simulate asset price paths and calculate the price of an Asian call option. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of our simulation, we will apply two variance reduction techniques: **Antithetic Variates** and **Control Variates**.

### Geometric Brownian Motion Model

The dynamics of the asset price follow the GBM equation:

$$
S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \cdot \exp\left( \left( r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z \right)
$$

where:

- $S_t$ is the asset price at time $t$,  $r$ is the risk-free interest rate;
- $\sigma$ is the volatility of the asset,  $\Delta t$ is the time step;
- $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.

### Asian Call Option

An Asian call option is a path-dependent option where the payoff depends on the average price of the asset over the option's life. The payoff function for an Asian call option is:

$$
\text{Payoff} = \max\left( \bar{S} - K, \, 0 \right)
$$

where:

- $\bar{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_{t_i}$ is the arithmetic average of the asset prices;
- $K$ is the strike price of the option.

### Parameters
Still take a call option as an example, the parameters are as follows:

| Parameter                            | Value                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spot price ($S_0$)                   | $222.91$                                                   |
| Strike price ($K$)                   | $230$                                                      |
| Maturity date                        | $2024-11-08$                                               |
| Today                                | $2024-11-01$                                               |
| TTM in years ($T$)                   | $\frac{\text{Maturity}_{\text{date}} - \text{today}}{365}$ |
| Risk-free rate ($r$)                 | $0.05$                                                     |
| Simulation times ($n_{simulations}$) | $10000$                                                    |
| Simulation steps ($n_{steps}$)       | $100$                                                      |
| Volatility ($\sigma$)                | $0.2751$                                                   |


## 3.2 Crude Monte Carlo Simulation

First, we use the basic Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate the price of the Asian call option.

### Formula

The estimated option price is:

$$
C_{\text{Crude}} = e^{-rT} \cdot \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{Payoff}_j
$$

where:

- $M$ is the number of simulated paths;
- $T$ is the time to maturity of the option;
- $\text{Payoff}_j$ is the payoff from the $j$-th simulation.

### Result

| Parameter                            | Value      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Call option price ($C_{Antithetic}$) | $0.1813$   |
| Std error                            | $0.008171$ |


## 3.3 Antithetic Variates

By using both a random variable $Z$ and its negative $-Z$ in the simulation, we generate pairs of asset price paths that are negatively correlated. 

### Formula

The estimated option price is:

$$
C_{\text{Antithetic}} = e^{-rT} \cdot \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \left( \frac{ \text{Payoff}_j + \text{Payoff}'_j }{2} \right)
$$

where $\text{Payoff}_j$ and $\text{Payoff}'_j$ are the payoffs from the original and antithetic paths, respectively, in the $j$-th simulation.

### Result

| Parameter                       | Value      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Call option price ($C_{Crude}$) | $0.1841$   |
| Std error                       | $0.008420$ |

## 3.4 Control Variates

Select a control variable $X$ that is highly correlated with the Asian option payoff $Y$ and whose expected value $E[X]$ is known (Here we take the payoff of a European call option). Adjust the estimate of $Y$ using $X$ to reduce variance.

### Formula


The adjust payoffs is:

      $$
   \beta = \frac{ \text{Cov}(Y, X) }{ \text{Var}(X) }
   $$$$
   Y^* = Y - \beta ( X - E[X] )
   $$$$
E[X] = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
$$
where:

- $d_1 = \frac{ \ln(S_0 / K) + (r + 0.5 \sigma^2) T }{ \sigma \sqrt{T} }$;
- $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$;
- $N(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

The estimated option price is:

$$
C_{\text{Control}} = e^{-rT} \cdot \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} Y^*_j
$$
### Result
| Parameter                         | Value      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Call option price ($C_{Control}$) | $0.1787$   |
| Std error                         | $0.006000$ |


## 3.5 Efficiency Gain Comparison

Efficiency gain is defined as the ratio of the variance of the Crude Monte Carlo method to the variance of the improved method:

$$
\text{Efficiency Gain} = \left( \frac{ SE_{\text{Crude}} }{ SE_{\text{Method}} } \right)^2
$$

### Results

| Parameter                            | Value      | Efficiency Gain |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| Call option price ($C_{Crude}$)      | $0.1841$   |                 |
| Std error                            | $0.008420$ |                 |
| Call option price ($C_{Antithetic}$) | $0.1813$   |                 |
| Std error                            | $0.008171$ | $6\%$           |
| Call option price ($C_{Control}$)    | $0.1787$   |                 |
| Std error                            | $0.006000$ | $97\%$          |

## 3.6 Conclusion

By implementing variance reduction techniques, we successfully increased the efficiency of the Monte Carlo simulation and reduced the variance of the option price estimates.

- **Antithetic Variates**: We can tell that antithetic variates method can reduce the variance a bit. This method is straightforward to implement, and if the option prices are more sensitive to the symmetry, this method could do better.
- **Control Variates**: When a suitable control variable with a known expected value is available and is highly correlated with the target variable, this method can significantly reduce variance. In our case, the variance of the estimates significantly decreases
